            Sex has always been traditionally regarded as a taboo subject to
            discuss. Many people seemed to ignore the fact how it could help
            young people, especially girls, to understand the changes that they
            will face with their bodies and mind.
          </p>
          <br />

          The definition of sex ed itself is a curriculum-based approach of
          teaching and learning about the cognitive, emotional, physical, and
          social elements of sexuality is known as comprehensive sexuality
          education.<br /><br />

          The goal is to provide children and young people with the knowledge,
          skills, attitudes, and values necessary to realize their health,
          well-being, and dignity; develop respectful social and sexual
          relationships; consider how their choices affect their own and others'
          well-being; and understand alongside with protecting their rights
          throughout their lives.

          <br /><br />Sex is nothing to be ashamed of, it is part of a natural
          and healthy desire we have as a human being. Unfortunately, society
          frequently fosters a sense of shame in women, particularly young
          women, around sex, implying that women who are aware of and understand
          the act of intercourse are a women with negative influence.
          <br /><br />

          It is also stated by Oxford Bibliographies that Education-based
          prevention initiatives, sometimes known as "sex education" programs,
          are one of the most effective ways to stop HIV/AIDS from spreading.
          Not only that, but according to Studies and Researchers from the
          University of Washington also finds that Comprehensive Sex Education
          Reduces Teen Pregnancy. Adolescents who receive the education are also
          reported to be much less likely to become pregnant than those who
          receive it only until marriage or no formal sex education at all.
          <br /><br />
          In the Guardian, Chernor Bah, a global education activist and former
          Sierra Leone refugee, wrote, “As boys and men see more educated girls
          in their midst, I believe they will be more likely to abandon their
          archaic perceptions of women as inferior and mere sexual objects with
          no meaningful role to play outside the home.”
          <br /><br />Thus, as stated. We arm women with the tools they need for
          life by providing them with an honest sexual education. We empower
          them to handle their own bodies, identities, and minds by not just
          teaching them how to protect themselves from AIDS, but also by
          teaching them about consent, sexual identity, their own anatomy, and
          pleasure. <br /><br />AIn conclusion, we should abolish past believe
          that sex education is something unnececary. We women deserve the
          knowledge to protect ourselves, to understand the consequences and how
          to live a healthier lifestyle.
